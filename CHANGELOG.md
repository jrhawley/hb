# Changelog

## [0.1.1] - 2022-04-22

### Added

- Ability to query by parent + sub-category
  - Parent categories are separated by their sub-categories with a `:`
  - It was previously impossible to distinguish between sub-categories with the same name, e.g. `Hello:There` and `WhoGoes:There`.
  - Now, you can include the entire parent + sub-category name in the query.

## [0.1.0] - 2022-04-14
